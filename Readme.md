# Set up work environment for Spine toolkits

## Python (virtual) environment setup
1. Download and install python interpreter
2. Create a virtual environment: "`X:\path\to\python\interpretor -m venv Y:\path\to\virtual_env_folder`"
3. In the Terminal, switch to the corresponding virtual environment
	- Run "`deactivate`" to exit current virenv
	- Run "`cd path\to\the\virenv\folder`"
	- Run "`.\Scripts\activate`" to activate the target virenv
	- Run "`pip install -e package`" in terminal under the activated virtual environment (the "`-e`" option is only needed for installing editable package, see [pip install options](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#options))
When the ipython and ipykernel (maybe only ipykernel needed) packages are installed, command "`pip install -e local\package`" can be used in the Python console where the new virtual environment is launched. 


## Julia environment setup
1. Install julia
2. Modify the environment variable "julia" to the latest Julia installed
	- System environment variable (if you install Julia for all users):
	"Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System --> Advanced system settings --> Advanced --> Environmental Variables --> Edit in `Path`" 
	    - under "User variables for `administrator_username`" (only for the administrator, under "System variables" for all users)
	- User environment variable (if you install Julia for the current user): 
	Search `environment variables` in the Windows taskbar --> "Edit environment variable for your account" --> Edit in `Path` under "User variables for `the_current_username`"
	- **Edit in `Path`**: Click `New` to add `X:\directory\to\Julia-x.x.x\bin` and delete the directory for old versions
    - In case the Jupyter notebook kernel needs updating, do: 
		```julia
		Pkg.update(); Pkg.build("IJulia")
		```
	- Renew the path of julia executable in VSCode
		- Settings --> Search "julia" --> Julia: Environment Path / Julia: Executable Path
3. Install Spine related jl package:
	- pkg> dev "...path to SpineOpt folder...",Â pkg> dev "...path to SpineInterface folder..."
4. Build `PyCall` environment

	There are 3 ways by which `PyCall.jl` could work for the `SpineInterface.jl` call use `spinedb-api`.
	- `pkg> add PyCall`
	- ***Option 1*** Install `spinedb_api` to the default conda python interpreter of Julia.
		- Confirm the default conda python is linked: 
		```julia
		julia> ENV["PYTHON"]=""
		julia> using PyCall
		julia> using Pkg
		julia> Pkg.build("PyCall")
		```
		- [Find the conda python](https://github.com/nnhjy/julia-introduction#manage-julia-conda-environment)
		- "X:\path\to\the\conda\python\folder\Scripts\pip.exe install -e path/to/local/spinedb_api"
	
	- ***Option 2*** Install `spinedb_api` to **the parent python interpreter** on which the virtual env is built (ref. [PyCall documentation](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) and [PyCall issue with virtual environment](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl/issues/706))
		- Run (with ipython and ipykernel installed) `pip install -e path/to/local/spinedb_api `
		- Otherwise, `X:\path\to\python\folder\Scripts\pip.exe install -e path/to/local/spinedb_api`
	- Build customised python interpreter: 
	- In Julia after activating the desired working environment:
		```julia
		julia> ENV["PYTHON"] = raw"C:\path\to\the\parent\python.exe"
		julia> import Pkg; Pkg.build("PyCall")
		```
	
	- ***Option 3 (recommended)*** For a dedicated virtual environment created by `venv` and `virtualenv`, PyCall could work provided that the Python executable used in the virtual environment is linked against the same libpython used by PyCall (`conda` environment not supported). See the explanation [here](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl#python-virtual-environments).
		- In command line: `virtual_env_folder\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
		- In Julia after activating the desired working environment:
		```julia
		julia> ENV["PYTHON"] = Sys.which("python")
		julia> ENV["PYCALL_JL_RUNTIME_PYTHON"] = Sys.which("python")
		julia> import Pkg; Pkg.build("PyCall")
		```
	
	- Relaunch Julia and check which python the PyCall is using: `PyCall.pyprogramname` or `PyCall.python`
	- Check packages that are available for the PyCall used python: 
		```julia
		julia> using PyCall; pyimport("sys").path
		py"""
		import pkgutil

		def get_available_packages():
    		available_packages = [name for _, name, _ in pkgutil.iter_modules()]
    		return available_packages
		"""
		available_packages = py"get_available_packages"()
		println(available_packages)
		```
		When `spinedb_api` package is in the list, it is good to go.
